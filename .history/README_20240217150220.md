# Movie API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing movies. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on movie records, including details such as title, director, genres, rating, streaming platform, description, and cast.

## Installation

Before diving in, ensure you have the following installed:

Go: Download and install Go from the official website (https://golang.org/doc/install) based on your operating system.
github.com/gorilla/mux: Use the following command in your terminal to install the required dependency:
Bash
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
Use code with caution.
## Running the Server

With everything set up, launch the server by running the following command in your terminal:

Bash
go run main.go
Use code with caution.
This will start the API server at port 8000. You can access it using your web browser at http://localhost:8000.

## API Endpoints

The API offers various endpoints to interact with your movie collection:

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/movies	Retrieve a list of all movies in your collection.
GET	/movies/{id}	Retrieve a specific movie by its unique ID.
POST	/movies	Create a new movie and add it to your collection.
PUT	/movies/{id}	Update an existing movie in your collection.
DELETE	/movies/{id}	Delete a movie from your collection by its ID.
## Data Structure

Movies within the API follow a well-defined JSON structure:

JSON
{
  "id": "1",
  "isbn": "438222",
  "title": "Iron Man",
  "director": {
    "firstname": "Sahil",
    "lastname": "Dhargave",
    "nationality": "Indian",
    "age": 34,
    "networth": "$234"
  },
  "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi", "Mystery"],
  "rating": 4.5,
  "streaming": "Netflix",
  "description": "Tony Stark...",
  "cast": ["Robert Downey Jr.", "Terrence Howard", ...]
}
Use code with caution.
Remember:

Each movie has a unique id for identification.
director is an optional nested object containing director information.
genres is an array listing associated movie genres.
rating is a floating-point number representing the movie's rating.
streaming denotes the service where the movie is available (optional).
description provides a brief overview of the movie (optional).
cast is an array listing actors participating in the movie (optional).
## Enhancements and Best Practices

While the provided code offers a solid foundation, here are some enhancements and best practices to consider:

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle invalid requests, missing data, or unexpected situations, providing informative error messages to clients.
Database Integration: For persistence and scalability, consider using a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB to store movie data instead of relying on an in-memory data store.
Validation: Add validation checks on incoming data (e.g., ensuring required fields are present, values are within expected ranges) to prevent invalid data from entering your system.
Authentication and Authorization: If this API is publicly accessible, implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and protect sensitive data.
Documentation: Provide more detailed documentation, including endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and usage tips, to make the API accessible to a wider audience.
